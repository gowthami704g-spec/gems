the world held its breath, waiting for the next moment to unfold
a faint scent of lavender hung in the air, a ghost of past seasons;
outside, 
shadows stretched long and thin as evening approached;
hello 

she poured a cup of tea, steam curling upwards like a question;
she poured a cup of tea, steam curling upwards like a question;
she poured a cup of tea, steam curling upwards like a question;
